Interrupt:
	Interrrupt is a simply a signal that the hardware can send when it wants the processor attention.

Installing Interrupt Handler:
	int request_irq(	/* interrupt number being requested */ 
					unsigned int irq,
				/* Pointer to the handling function being installed */ 
					irqreturn_t (*handler)(int,void*,struct pt_regs *),
				/* expected bit mask options related tointerrupt management */ 
					unsigned long flags,
				/* string passed to request_irq is used in /proc/interrupts to show the owner of interrupt */
					const char *dev_name,
				/* Pointer used for shared Interrupt Lines
				   It is unique identifier that is used when the interrupt line free
				   and also used by the driver to points to its own private data area( to identify  which device is 					   interrupting )
				   if interrupt is not shared, dev_id can be NULL */
					void *dev_id
			);

How can we set the bits in flags ?

SA_INTERRUPT
	Indicates a fast interrupt handler.
	Fast interrupt handlers are executed with interrupts disabled on the current processor.
SA_SHIRQ
	This bit signals that the interrupt  can be shared between the devices.
SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM



Where can we install the interuupt handler?
	1. At the time of driver initialization.
	2. when the device is first opened.
